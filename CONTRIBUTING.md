Kuali OLE is distributed under the Educational Community License, version 2.0 (ECL 2.0), and all contributions must be distributable under that license. In order to do this, we require that contributors sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which will need to be submitted to the Kuali Foundation. In addition, the Kuali Foundation requires each institution that employs contributors to sign a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA). For details, see the License Agreement Process.
